# ProjectEuler
A repo working through the [project euler challenges](https://projecteuler.net/). 

This project can be build and run as follows:
```
mvn install
java -jar target/ProjectEuler<version>.jar
```

### March 2023

Picked up after a very long period of inactivity. Currently at 50 problems.
Seems newer hardware and better JVM gave a nice performance boost.
